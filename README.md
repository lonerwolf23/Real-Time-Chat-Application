# Real-Time-Chat-Application
The Real-Time Chat Application is a dynamic, web-based platform built to allow users to send and receive messages in real time. Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Socket.IO, and MongoDB, this application provides a seamless chat experience by connecting users across multiple chat rooms.

Features:
User Authentication: Users can choose a unique username to participate in the chat, ensuring no impersonation.
Multiple Chat Rooms: Users can either join existing rooms or create new ones for specific conversations.
Responsive Design: The user interface is optimized for various screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across devices.
Message Timestamps: Each message is timestamped, allowing users to see when messages were sent.
Text Formatting: Basic formatting (bold, italics) can be applied to messages for improved readability.
